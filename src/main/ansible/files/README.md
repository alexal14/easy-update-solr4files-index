For now `solr-cores/fielitems/schema.xml` is a duplicate of the [dtap-schema](https://github.com/DANS-KNAW/easy-dtap/blob/ae26915/provisioning/roles/easy_solr_search2/files/fileitems/schema.xml)


Manifests of pdbs bags are not valid
------------------------------------

Real life bags were used as a basis.
Files were dropped from `files.xml` and the `data` folder to reduce processing time.
Adjusting manifests is not required for the indexing process, hence they are not changed.
